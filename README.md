## Sliding Window Array Compression in Python

This code implements a Python function for compressing arrays using sliding windows. It works by first creating a set of unique sets of a fixed window size from the array. Then, it creates a mapping from the unique sets to integers. Finally, it compresses the array by replacing each window of elements with its corresponding integer value in the mapping.
